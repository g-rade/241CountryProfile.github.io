# **Ukraine**

At the start of the Ukraine War in 2022, Germany took part in the swift economic sanctions imposed on Russia by other nations. This included suspending the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which brought Russian oil to Western Europe. Additionally, Germany joined in the no-fly zone for Russian aircraft and sent arms and weapons to Ukraine. 

Sending arms to Ukraine represented a policy shift for Germany, as the law forbids sending weapons to conflict zones. However, this policy shift may not set new norms for German behavior in regards to defense, as each similar circumstance is decided on a case by case basis.  

As the war continues, Scholz and Germany will have to balance the domestic economic impact of the sanctions against Russia with sufficient punishment of the offending nation.
